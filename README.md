# Landslide Risk Prediction using Deep Learning

Landslides are a recurring and deadly hazard in regions like Uttarakhand, Mizoram, and other vulnerable areas. This project applies deep learning techniques to predict and map landslide-prone regions using multi-modal satellite and terrain data. The goal is to support disaster preparedness and risk mitigation through more accurate landslide risk mapping.

## Project Highlights

- **Data:** Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (RGB, NIR, SWIR), topographic data from ALOS PALSAR (slope and elevation), and NDVI vegetation index.
- **Pipeline:**
  - U-Net for pixel-wise segmentation to identify landslide areas.
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image-level classification to predict whether an entire patch contains landslide-prone terrain.
- **Performance:** U-Net achieved approximately 98.8% segmentation accuracy. The CNN classifier reached about 89.5% accuracy on image-level classification.

## Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Google Colab, LaTeX.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

Key Learnings
Through this project, I gained practical experience in applying deep learning to real-world geospatial problems. I learned to process and combine multi-modal remote sensing data, design encoderâ€“decoder segmentation models, build binary classifiers, and evaluate models with appropriate metrics. This project strengthened my understanding of how AI can contribute meaningfully to disaster risk reduction.
